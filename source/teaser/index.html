# The Web Is...

## An article within a web page

With this site, we thought we'd try something new. The web to us is an extremely powerful resource for educating, if it weren't for 'view source' a lot of us would never have had the urge to start designing and developing our own sites. With that in mind we have put together a full article to explain the goals and process involved in making this site.

When planning the site we thought, could a graphically rich site both look great and also be incredibly fast and lightweight? With that goal, the plan evolved that we would create a site using only HTML, CSS and entirely encapsulated in one single page request. A challenge, but read on and we'll go through each step.

## What we'll cover

The plan is to step through the HTML of this web site, and along the way discuss some of the work that went into each part. Along the way we'll cover how to set up a Grunt.js workflow, how to embed custom fonts on a page, working with CSS transforms, and even a little bit of vanilla JavaScript.

## Why one request?

When a website loads, it makes lots of "requests" to one or more servers for each of the components of the page. These requests could be for stylesheets, images, script files and much more. Every time your browser makes such a request, it takes a small amount of time to set up the back-and-forth necessary to explain to the server what it's asking for. These small moments may be insignificant by themselves but if you have many of them happening, the result is that the page feels slower.

In this case we want to build a single page website that is as fast as we can make it, so to try to maximise the speed we'll put everything into one file, with one page request.

Let's get started!

## Head first

We begin with the standard HTML5-style boilerplate. Inside the head of the page, we have the usual `title` tag. We then set some meta data. `Viewport` is a setting that tells mobile devices how much to zoom when the page is first loaded. We could use this to lock the zooming at a certain scale but doing that can make the site less accessible.

Next, we move on to styles.

## Inline styles

As part of the mission to reduce page requests, we're putting all the styles into the document. Generally, as a rule, I'd recommend include styles in a separate stylesheet. The single extra page request is more than made up for by the advantage of letting the browser cache the file, so that it isn't downloaded again when used on other pages.

We will step through these styles and describe them.

       *
       * The body tag is where we'll add some settings that cascade down through other elements and impact how they look. We're setting the font-size in pixels here, but in the rest of the CSS we'll use `em`. Since the em value (the width of the letter "m") is dependant on this size, the pixel based font-size here acts as an anchor to the overall size of all the elements on the page.
       *
       * To add a bit of style to the page we're using some CSS animation. */

      /* ### CSS Animation
       *
       * In CSS, you can animate elements on the page in all sorts of ways. They can be transitioned between any number of states to make quite complex animations. Creating an animation involves two steps. The first is to add an `animation` property to the element being animated.
       *
       * In the example above I've set the animation property to run the `fade-in` animation for 2 seconds. The `forwards` value instructs the animation to only play once.
       *
       * Next, we create set of `keyframes` that describe what the animation does. Keyframes are a series of steps that describe each "step" and the browser will transition between each. Our example looks like this: */

      @-webkit-keyframes fade-in {
        0% {
          opacity: 0;
        }

        100% {
          opacity: 1;
        }
      }

      @keyframes fade-in {
        0% {
          opacity: 0;
        }

        100% {
          opacity: 1;
        }
      }

      /* Keyframes are shown as a percentage, indicating how far through the animation each keyframe is. In this case it begins with an `opacity` of zero, and ends totally opaque. */

                perspective-origin: 50% 7em;
      }

      /* The main thing to point out here is the use of `perspective` and `perspective-origin`. The element with class "stage" is a container that we'll build a 3D model inside, and in order to do that we tell the browser as much. The `perspective` setting is like the 3D depth of the scene, with lower values creating more dramatic angles, and a larger value creating a deeper scene with more gently angles. */

      .positioning-start,
      .positioning,
      .positioning-active {
        position: absolute;
        top: 1.5em;

        -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;
                transform-style: preserve-3d;
      }

      /* Another thing to note is the use of `transform-style`. This property, when set to `preserve-3d`, tells the browser that any 3D transforms should act according to the `perspective` value we set in the parent element. With this set, we can apply animations or transitions that use CSS `transforms` to rotate the element.
       *
       * In this case, the "positioning" element is a container I'm using to contain the Mac Plus, and I'm adding some variations which I'll adjust on the fly using JavaScript later. Moving on... */

       *
       * The Mac Plus is made up of two boxes, one that sits on top and is tilted back a little, and a second cube that sits underneath to act as a base.
       *
       * Each of these boxes is made up of flat `span` elements positioned using CSS `transforms`. For a more detailed overview of the steps involved, see [the Mac Plus blog post](http://hop.ie/blog/macplus). */

        /* Since the Mac Plus is made up of lots of `span` elements, we save time by declaring some properties that will apply to all `spans`.
         *
         * Next we go through each of the parts. Each of these is represented by a `span` in the HTML, which we'll see later.
         *
         * The front is the first one. It's given a height and width, background color and then moved into place using transforms.
         *
         * ### Transformation
         *
         * CSS contains properties that allow us to move our HTML elements around. We can rotate them, skew them, and even position them within a 3D space. It gets really interesting when we add in CSS animation to create some impressive effects.
         *
         * In this case the transform rule tilts the screen back a little, and then moves it forward (toward us) by 5.43em. */
        /* Something else to point out here, is the use of borders. The front of the Mac Plus has bevelled edges. In the article on hop.ie, I made use of extra HTML elements to create these edges, but it's not necessary. When borders with different colours meet, they meet at an angle that looks similar to the bevelled effect. */
        /* We then create the effect of an inset screen on the front. The container has rounded corners and a gradient to imply shadow. The `linear-gradient` in the background creates this effect. */
        /* The various other parts of the Mac Plus are positioned and styled in a similar way. */

      ## HTML

      Now that we've embedded all the necessary styles, fonts and Modernizr script, it's time to supply HTML. 

      The structure of the page has been set up so that if CSS is disabled, the important content is shown first. This should make the page accessible to a wider range of readers.
